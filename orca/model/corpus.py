"""
Module for managing document corpuses within the application.

This module provides the `Corpus` class and associated functionality for taking
snapshots of document collections, which is crucial for ensuring the
consistency and integrity of search results over time. By capturing a specific
set of documents at a moment in time, the `Corpus` class allows for versioning,
comparison, and generation of diffs, making it possible to track changes and
maintain historical accuracy.
