"""
Models to track artifacts and related metadata within ORCA's corpus.

This module provides ORM models for managing scans and documents within ORCA's
corpus. Each `Scan` represents an immutable image file associated with an
artifact, along with its metadata. The `Document` model tracks specific
revisions of text or metadata associated with these scans, allowing for
versioning and historical record-keeping.

class Scan(Base):
    """Represents an immutable image file associated with an artifact.

    This model stores metadata for the base image file of an artifact and
    serves as its primary reference point. Every artifact in ORCA's corpus must
    have at least one `Scan` associated with it and at least one `Document`
    associated with that `Scan`.

    Attributes:
        stem (str): The original filename without extension. This can be used
            to construct other filenames/URLs or to parse essential metadata.
            Typically formatted as: `000001_2022-09-27_13-12-42_image_5992`,
            where:
            - `000001` is the album index.
            - `2022-09-27_13-12-42` is the scan timestamp.
            - `image_5992` is the scan title.
        album (str): The album name, used to organize `Scan` objects into
            folders. Typically based on the year and month of the scan, though
            other configurations are possible.
        album_index (int): The index of the `Scan` within its album.
        title (str): The title of the `Scan`, usually derived from the original
            file stem.
        path (str, optional): The relative path to the original image file.
        url (str, optional): The full URL of the image file.
        thumb_url (str, optional): The full URL of the thumbnail image.
        scanned_at (datetime, optional): The timestamp of when the image was
            taken or scanned, in UTC. Defaults to January 1, 1970.
        media_archive (str, optional): The archive or institution holding the
            original artifact.
        media_collection (str, optional): The collection within the archive.
        media_box (str, optional): The box name or number within the collection.
        media_folder (str, optional): The folder name or number within the box.
        media_type (str, optional): A description of the type of artifact (e.g.,
            photograph, manuscript).
        media_created_at (datetime, optional): The timestamp of when the
            artifact was originally created. Defaults to January 1, 1970.
