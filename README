######################

ORCA (Optical Recognition and Content Analysis) is an AI-powered Digital Humanities stack designed to digitize, index, parse, browse, and search documents. It turns scans or photographs into a workable corpus, organizes them, and produces artifacts to be used in research, writing, and teaching.

ORCA is in very early development, and is stored at https://github.com/kwgs/orca.
